# HarperDB Custom Functions - REST Recipe

This project recipe creates a dynamic REST interface for HarperDB database, granting you access to CRUD operations using standard GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests.

The repository includes a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection, which will allow you to test the endpoints against your own data. As the REST API template was dynamic, so are the URLs in the Postman collection. Here's a link to this project's environment [variables]("https://go.postman.co/workspace/My-Workspace~58429cc6-621f-475d-8f01-b3cdfe0c9dd6/environment/18074441-ed8f2c6b-63dd-4121-a71d-178ec5206cd0"). You will likely need to change some values to fit your project. OR you may also hard-code the route for your needs, (ex: http://localhost:9926/project/schema/table plus any necessary route parameter such as "id".)
