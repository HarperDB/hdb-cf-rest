# HarperDB Custom Functions - REST Recipe

This project recipe creates a dynamic REST interface for HarperDB database, granting you access to CRUD operations using standard GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests.

The repository includes a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection, which will allow you to test the endpoints against your own data. You may find it useful to compose environment variables, (ex: variable- "project", value- "dog_app", variable- "schema", value- "dev", etc) in Postman, OR you may also hard-code the route for your needs, (ex: http://localhost:9926/project/schema/table plus any necessary route parameter such as "id".)
