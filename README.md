# HarperDB Custom Functions - REST Recipe

This project recipe creates a dynamic REST interface for HarperDB database, granting you access to CRUD operations using standard GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, and PATCH requests.

The repository includes a [Postman](https://www.postman.com/) collection, which will allow you to test the endpoints against our standard `dev.dog` sample dataset.
